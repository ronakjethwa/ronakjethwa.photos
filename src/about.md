ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm {{ site.author.firstName }} {{ site.author.lastName}}. I am currently based out of San Francisco, California and love capturing moments.

My favorite subjects include breathtaking landscapes, candid street photography, and the intricate details of nature. I believe every photograph tells a story, and I strive to convey narratives through a different lens.
